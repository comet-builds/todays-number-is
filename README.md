## About the Project
For several years, David Lynch shared short daily videos in which he calmly drew a numbered ball and announced:

> “Today’s number is…”

They were not about the number itself. They were about **showing up**, **marking time**, and **paying attention**.

This project exists to commemorate that ritual.

## What Will Today’s Number Be?
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser or access via [GitHub Pages](https://comet-builds.github.io/todays-number-is/).
2. Click **START**.
3. Let the sequence unfold.

In **Deterministic Mode**, the number is generated algorithmically from the current date. The same number appears for everyone on a given day.
In **Random Mode**, the number is chosen freely each time for those who prefer chance over ritual.
